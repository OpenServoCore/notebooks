# Stage 5. Closed loop

The servo's own closed loop, scored. A firmware build runs one fixed set of
tests in Position mode, and the scorecard turns the rows into a short list
of numbers: how far a move overshoots and how long it takes to settle,
where it comes to rest, how closely it follows a slow goal, how still it
holds. A change to the firmware or its settings is kept when the numbers
get better and dropped when they do not. A notebook comes once there is
data.

Nothing here describes what the firmware does. A build is named by its
commit and the sha1 of its image, and its settings by the CONFIG snapshot
every capture's `meta.json` carries.

## The three kinds of data

- **The test set**, [scorecard/testset.py](scorecard/testset.py). Three
  captures per run, each one `osc-lab track` call: `steps` (the first
  second after torque-on, then moves of 2, 20 and 60 degrees each way from
  the center and back), `follow` (goal ramps as a 50 Hz host sends them,
  at 1, 3 and 10 % of the no-load speed, up and back down) and `hold` (two
  three-second holds at the center). It is written in the servo's own
  terms: degrees through the stage 3 pot-table's counts per degree, speeds
  as shares of the stage 3 run-up's no-load speed, the center the middle
  of the servo's soft range. A servo whose soft range cannot fit it is
  refused. Each capture writes a `plan.json` beside its rows naming every
  segment.
- **The runs**, under `telemetry/<servo>__<board>/scorecard/<label>/`. A
  rung is one build at one label, `run-1` to `run-K` inside it, and
  `rung.json` with the label, the commit, the image sha, a note, the time
  and a hash of the CONFIG it ran on.
- **The results**, one file per rung,
  `scorecard/results/<servo>__<board>/<label>.json`: every score as the
  median over the rung's runs with their range as the bounds.

Every score reads the pot. How each one is taken is in the docstrings of
`oscnb/scorecard.py`.

## Running it

The servo on the board and the DPS at its rated voltage, the adapter on
the bus at 3 Mbps, torque off, the production image flashed. The runner
never touches the supply and never prompts; it refuses to start otherwise.

```
uv run python -m oscnb.scorecard run --label 00-baseline --fw <commit> --image-sha <sha1> [--runs 3] [--note TEXT]
uv run python -m oscnb.scorecard score 00-baseline
uv run python -m oscnb.scorecard table
```

`table` prints the ladder, one column per rung in label order, with a
last column of other people's figures for stock smart servos (STS3215,
LX-16A) where a row has one, for scale only.
